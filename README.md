# 01-GUESSING
Guessing Game created as the first project of G220: Game Technology class. Enjoy!
Created as a means to teach me basic data types and control structures by creating a simple game for a class project.

The object of the game is to guess a number between 1 and 100. You have as many opportunities as you need, with simple hints and a counter tracking your attempts. Good Luck!


I'd have loved to add the following responses based on the input of certain integers.


42 = "Ah! The center of the universe! A personal favorite of mine."

420 = "Favor yourself a memester huh? Thats out of range, but I owe some respect."

69 = "Cheeky."

13 = "The luckiest, or unluckiest number - depends on the person. Don't let the horror movie producers hear you calling superstitions BS."

1 = "Ah. The loneliest number."

0 = "ERROR//"
